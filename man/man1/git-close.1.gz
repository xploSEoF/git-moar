Rather than expecting you to be on the into-branch (typically the main/master branch) and merge some other work in (the working-branch), git close expects you to by default be on the working-branch and say what the into-branch is using "git merge"\&.
Additionally, close expects the branch to have been rebased atop the into-branch
